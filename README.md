# About
Language learning java application created for one of my university classes.
The project required that we store the users in a text file to illustrate how much easier it is to work with a database.

# Running the app
Run `mvn clean install` to install all the neccessary dependencies.
After that, run the installed h2 database and execute the sql script provided in the repository to insert some data.
Adjust the variables in the `dat/database.properties` file and run `mvn javafx:run` to start the application.
